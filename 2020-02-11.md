## 1. 大自然在说话 第二集 海洋 听写
I am the ocean. I'm water. I'm most of this planet. ~~I shape it.~~ **I had shaped it**. Every stream, every cloud and every raindrop, ~~that~~ **It** all comes back to me. One way or another. Every living thing here needs me. I'm the source. I am what ~~they're proud of~~ they crawled out of. Humans, they are not different. I don't owe them a thing. I give, they take. But I can always take back. That's just the way it's always been. It's not their planet anyway. Never was. Never will be. But humans, they take more than they share. They poison me ~~and~~**, then** expect me to feed them. Well, it doesn't work ~~anyway~~ **that way**. If humans wants to exist ~~on~~ **in** the nature with me and off of me. I suggest they listen ~~closely~~ **close**. I'm ~~not~~ **only** going to say this once. If nature isn't kept healthy, humans won't survive ~~simply, either.~~ **Simple as that.** I can give them without humans. I am the ocean. I ~~cover~~ **covered** this entire planet once, and I can always cover again. That's all I have to say.

我是海洋。我是水。我覆盖了大部分地球。我创造了它。每一条河流，每一片云，每一个雨滴，都将回到我的怀抱。不管怎样，地球上的每一种生物都离不开我。所有的生命都来自于我。人类呢？他们也不例外。我什么都不欠他们。我一直在给予，而他们一直在索取。但我也能随时将一切收回。这不是他们的星球。以前不是，以后也不是。但是人类，他们贪得无厌。他们毒害我，竟然还想让我继续养活他们。这怎么可能呢？如果人类想在大自然中与我共存赖我而生。我要他们仔细听。我只说一遍。没有健康的大自然，人类就将走向灭亡。道理就这么简单。因为我是海洋，我曾经覆盖了整个星球，并且我也可以再次全部覆盖它。这就是我要说的。
