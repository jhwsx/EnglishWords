## 2. Nature is speaking 第一集 听写
Some call me nature，others call me Mother nature. I've been here for over 4.5 billion years, 22,500 times longer than you. I don't really need people, but people need me. Yes, your future depends on me. When I thrive, you thrive. When I falter, you falter, or worse. But I've been here for eons. I have fed species greater than you. And I have starved species greater than you. My oceans. My soil. My flowing streams. My forests. They all can take you or leave you. How you choose to live each day whether you regard or disregard me doesn't really matter to me. One way or the other. Your actions will determine your fate. Not mine. I am nature. I will go on. I am prepared to evolve. Are you?

有人称我为大自然，也有人叫我大自然母亲。我已经在这里超过 45 亿年了，是你们人类存在时间的 22500 倍。我不需要人类，但人类离不开我。是的，你的未来取决于我。当我繁盛，你就繁盛。当我衰落，你就衰落。甚至更糟。但我已经存在了亿万年了。我养育过比你更强大的物种。我也让比你更强大的物种挨饿。我的海洋。我的土地。我的河流。我的森林。它们都可以左右你。你选择怎样度过每一天，在意我或者忽视我，我并不在乎。你的行为决定了你的命运。而非我的命运。我是大自然。我将继续存在。我随时都在进化。而你们呢？
